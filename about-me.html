	<p> My name is Merit Onyekwere and I was born in Dallas, Texas on December 23, 2004. I'm Nigerian American and I spent a year of my life living in Nigeria until we moved back to the United States. My parents both immigrated from the U.S. and started their family before moving to California for work. My early life consisted of a lot of reading and writing, and I would do a dance club every day after school.

	<p> Nowadays, I still read, write, and dance; but I also play several sports and instruments. I play volleyball, did track and field, and was a cheerleader last year. I play the guitar and ukulele, although I haven't practiced in a long time due to my busy schedule. I also was class president and an active member of the Drama Club. I was the lead in the fall play, and I focused more on student council in the spring.
